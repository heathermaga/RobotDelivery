# RobotDelivery
Javascript Code Sample

Robbie the robot and his pals deliver presents to houses. Build a program that runs a simulation given a number of robots and a string of their orders, keeps track of the state of the robots, and the presents they’ve delivered.

The robots move in the 4 cardinal directions. They each take turns. On a robot’s turn they will read one instruction from the moves sequence, move in the indicated direction, and attempt to deliver their present.

A robot may deliver a present if, and only if, there are no other robots on the space in which they are ending their turn.
